***Speaker 1: Dr Kim Baraka (VU)***

Title: How the performing arts can help us develop more capable interactive robots

Abstract: In this talk, I will discuss the interplay between my background as an interactive robotics researcher and my background as a dance artist. I will discuss concrete ways in which the performing arts, and particularly expertise and knowledge from dance, can inspire, inform, and help test technical advances in interactive robotics, from social robots to physically assistive robots. This will use the following op-ed piece as a starting point https://shorturl.at/yCPHr.

About the Speaker: Kim Baraka is a tenured assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at the Free University (VU) in Amsterdam, and member of the Social AI group. Before joining the VU, he was a postdoctoral fellow in the Socially Intelligent Machines Lab at UT Austin. He holds a dual Ph.D. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon, Portugal and a M.S. in Robotics from CMU. His interdisciplinary research, at the cross-roads of human-centered robotics, machine learning, and dance, focuses on enabling robots and humans to teach and learn from each other through situated social interactions. He is part of the Hybrid Intelligence Center, which fundamentally researches hybrid human-AI systems, with applications to healthcare and education. As a professionally trained contemporary dancer, he is particularly interested in new frontiers in robotics that draw inspiration from the performing arts.

***Speaker 2: Dr Rosa Wevers (Minerva Academy, Groningen)***

Title: Algorithmic Surveillance: A curatorial Inquiry

Abstract: This presentation explores the critical potential of curatorial inquiry in the realm of algorithmic surveillance. I reflect on the exhibition ‘Face Value’ (2021), a research-exhibition (Sheikh 2015) I curated in collaboration with IMPAKT [Centre for Media Culture]. Through a series of artistic interventions, ‘Face Value’ sought to defamiliarize the normalized technologies of algorithmic surveillance, revealing their hidden politics. By creating these defamiliarizations, the exhibition aimed to engage visitors not just in sense-making but also in sensing surveillance, ultimately offering tools for them to become more responsive to it. In doing so, the research-exhibition aimed to foster a critical surveillance spectatorship.

About the Speaker: Dr. Rosa Wevers works as Senior Researcher Art & Technology at Research Centre Art & Society (part of Minerva Art Academy in Groningen). She is co-curator at Noorderlicht (platform for lens-based media), and host of the podcast Kunstmatig. In her research and curatorial practice, Rosa explores the relations between art, technology and society. Rosa obtained her PhD at Utrecht University. Her project explored how contemporary art exhibitions confront visitors with critical perspectives on surveillance and engage them in strategies of resistance. As part of her PhD, Rosa curated the exhibition 'Face Value' in 2021, in collaboration with 2021 IMPAKT [Center for Media Culture] and NFF.

### #1 — Inaugural Seminar: 20 November 2024, Lab42, L3.33, 15:30-17:00

***Speaker 1: Dr Abdallah El Ali (CWI, UU)***

Abstract: As AI-generated information proliferates online and becomes increasingly indistinguishable from human-sourced information, it becomes critical to understand how we trust and label such content, especially should such information be inaccurate. For example, misleading labels or unclear sourcing can result in misinformation and poor health decisions, even if (honest) AI system disclosures are increasingly mandated by regulations (e.g., European AI Act). In this talk, I will highlight the importance of considering ‘what’, ‘how’, and ‘when’ AI disclosures are given within two domains, news media content and personal health information. I will show early results on how AI transparency disclosures can impact people’s perceived trust, behavior, and physiological indicators. I will conclude by highlighting our research efforts for creating *responsible* human-AI interactions at the user interface level, specifically the potential for developing intelligent user interfaces that can infer if and when to apply AI disclosures using sensed behavioral and physiological data.

About the Speaker: Abdallah “Abdo” El Ali is a research scientist at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, and part-time Assistant Professor at Utrecht University. He leads the research areas on Affective Interactive Systems and Trustworthy Human-AI Interaction, where he combines advances in sensing and actuation, eXtended Reality, and Artificial Intelligence to augment human cognitive, affective, and social interactions. He is also affiliated with the AI, Media, and Democracy Lab, where he leads Human-AI Interaction research focusing on AI transparency in media. He serves as Chair of CHI Nederland (CHI NL), the ACM SIGCHI Netherlands Chapter. Website: https://abdoelali.com/

Title: From prompt engineering to prompt design. Prompting generative visual AI for [biodiversity]

Abstract: This presentation briefly outlines a conceptual and practical agenda for doing research with generative visual AI that moves from prompt engineering towards prompt design. It illustratesone particular prompt design strategy -that of ‘ambiguous prompting’- with a small case study on bias in AI-generated representations of biodiversity.

About the Speaker: Dr. Sabine Niederer is Professor of Visual Methodologies at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (www.visualmethodologies.org), head of ARIAS – platform for artistic research (http://arias.amsterdam) and co-coordinator of the Digital Methods Initiative at the University of Amsterdam (www.digitalmethods.net). Together with Gabriele Colombo, she recently published the book Visual Methods for Digital Research (2024).
