title: AI, Culture, and Society Seminar
---

A collaboration between the Multimedia Analytics research group at IvI and the AI, Culture, and Society research group at the ILLC. All events will take place at Lab42 in the Amsterdam Science Park from 15:30 to 17:00 on Wednesdays once a month. 

## Theme: AI, Visual Culture, and Power

### #1 — Inaugural Seminar

**20 November 2024, Lab42, L3.33, 15:30-17:00**

***Speaker 1: Dr Abdallah El Ali (CWI, UU)***

Abstract: As AI-generated information proliferates online and becomes increasingly indistinguishable from human-sourced information, it becomes critical to understand how we trust and label such content, especially should such information be inaccurate. For example, misleading labels or unclear sourcing can result in misinformation and poor health decisions, even if (honest) AI system disclosures are increasingly mandated by regulations (e.g., European AI Act). In this talk, I will highlight the importance of considering ‘what’, ‘how’, and ‘when’ AI disclosures are given within two domains, news media content and personal health information. I will show early results on how AI transparency disclosures can impact people’s perceived trust, behavior, and physiological indicators. I will conclude by highlighting our research efforts for creating *responsible* human-AI interactions at the user interface level, specifically the potential for developing intelligent user interfaces that can infer if and when to apply AI disclosures using sensed behavioral and physiological data.

About the Speaker: Abdallah “Abdo” El Ali is a research scientist at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, and part-time Assistant Professor at Utrecht University. He leads the research areas on Affective Interactive Systems and Trustworthy Human-AI Interaction, where he combines advances in sensing and actuation, eXtended Reality, and Artificial Intelligence to augment human cognitive, affective, and social interactions. He is also affiliated with the AI, Media, and Democracy Lab, where he leads Human-AI Interaction research focusing on AI transparency in media. He serves as Chair of CHI Nederland (CHI NL), the ACM SIGCHI Netherlands Chapter. Website: https://abdoelali.com/

Title: From prompt engineering to prompt design. Prompting generative visual AI for [biodiversity]

Abstract: This presentation briefly outlines a conceptual and practical agenda for doing research with generative visual AI that moves from prompt engineering towards prompt design. It illustratesone particular prompt design strategy -that of ‘ambiguous prompting’- with a small case study on bias in AI-generated representations of biodiversity.

About the Speaker: Dr. Sabine Niederer is Professor of Visual Methodologies at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (www.visualmethodologies.org), head of ARIAS – platform for artistic research (http://arias.amsterdam) and co-coordinator of the Digital Methods Initiative at the University of Amsterdam (www.digitalmethods.net). Together with Gabriele Colombo, she recently published the book Visual Methods for Digital Research (2024).
