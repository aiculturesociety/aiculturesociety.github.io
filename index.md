### #4 — Searching Collections in the Age of Generative AI Models: 8 May 2025, Lab42, L1.07, 15:30-17:00

***Speaker: Dr Jaap Kamps (UvA)***

Title: Compress, Retrieve, Generate: Searching Collections in the Age of Generative AI Models

Abstract: Generative information access models enable revolutionary progress in information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP).  The main drivers are ever larger language models trained on endless next token prediction (or image patches).  By nature, this results in a text (image) generation or completion model. This is fine for chatbots and free conversation, but not for searching specific collections or finding reliable information. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is essential for grounded, evidence-based answers, but are currently limited in the context we can provide to the model. What is the current state of the art in using RAG for searching collections?

About the Speaker: Jaap Kamps is associate professor of Information Retrieval at the Faculty of Humanities. His research is part of the Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation. Both are part of the University of Amsterdam.

***Speaker 2: Dr Rosa Wevers (Minerva Academy, Groningen)***

Title: Algorithmic Surveillance: A curatorial Inquiry

Abstract: This presentation explores the critical potential of curatorial inquiry in the realm of algorithmic surveillance. I reflect on the exhibition ‘Face Value’ (2021), a research-exhibition (Sheikh 2015) I curated in collaboration with IMPAKT [Centre for Media Culture]. Through a series of artistic interventions, ‘Face Value’ sought to defamiliarize the normalized technologies of algorithmic surveillance, revealing their hidden politics. By creating these defamiliarizations, the exhibition aimed to engage visitors not just in sense-making but also in sensing surveillance, ultimately offering tools for them to become more responsive to it. In doing so, the research-exhibition aimed to foster a critical surveillance spectatorship.

About the Speaker: Dr. Rosa Wevers works as Senior Researcher Art & Technology at Research Centre Art & Society (part of Minerva Art Academy in Groningen). She is co-curator at Noorderlicht (platform for lens-based media), and host of the podcast Kunstmatig. In her research and curatorial practice, Rosa explores the relations between art, technology and society. Rosa obtained her PhD at Utrecht University. Her project explored how contemporary art exhibitions confront visitors with critical perspectives on surveillance and engage them in strategies of resistance. As part of her PhD, Rosa curated the exhibition 'Face Value' in 2021, in collaboration with 2021 IMPAKT [Center for Media Culture] and NFF.

### #2 — AI in Film, From Production to Analysis: 30 January 2025, 15:30–17:00, Lab42, Room L3.36, Amsterdam Science Park

This seminar will delve into the role of AI in film, exploring its application in both creative production and critical study.

**Invited Speakers:**

- **Jorge Caballero (Artefacto Film & Universidad Pompeu Fabra)**

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into audiovisual production represents a transformative shift in the creation and analysis of cinematic narratives. At Artefacto, we explore the intersection of AI and filmmaking through research and production that combines technological innovation with critical reflection. This presentation examines case studies from Artefacto’s ongoing projects, including OpenDocs, an initiative providing documentarians with AI tools to expand the creative and technical possibilities of storytelling. Drawing from a qualitative and quantitative analysis of over 300 short films and AI-driven works, we highlight recurring trends in the application of generative AI. These include iterative workflows for narrative development, character design, and visual production, alongside insights into the challenges of ethical authorship and creative agency. Through the analysis of large-scale data and multiple case studies from Artefacto's ongoing projects, including short films and experimental works, we aim to critically assess how AI is fostering new forms of audiovisual representation. These case studies illustrate the integration of traditional cinematic methodologies with cutting-edge AI technologies, showcasing how Artefacto innovates and redefines workflows, narrative structures, and visual aesthetics while critically interrogating the evolving landscape of filmmaking.

About the speaker: Jorge Caballero is a versatile creator and researcher working at the crossroads of technology, cinema, and social impact.

Title: Identifying Nudity in National Cinemas: Potentials and Pitfalls of Computer Vision

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision have piqued the interest of film scholars given their potential to test hypotheses about large film corpora, such as the film productions of entire countries through the years. As a case study, we focus on the reputation that certain national cinemas (in particular, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark) have for containing more frequent displays of explicit nudity. In order to test whether this reputation is warranted, we have applied computer vision methods in combination with close readings of a sample of images from a swathe of Dutch, Scandinavian, and US (known for their relative lack of nudity) films. We take as our corpus films shown to Amsterdam audiences in the sample years of 1952, 1962, 1972, and 1982. Our results indicate that while current open models are prone to errors, particularly in the shape of false positives, they can provide convincing evidence of trends and indicate that the Dutch and Scandinavian reputations for nudity are warranted. Furthermore, the process of engaging with such models forced us to face just how subjective the definition of nudity is, since we had relatively high inter-coder disagreement during manual coding. Ultimately, our study underscores the necessity of reflexive and critical scholarship that is interdisciplinary and blends digital methods with humanistic interpretation. Amidst the AI hype, it's crucial to recognize the complexities inherent in historical analysis and engage in nuanced discussions about the role of technology in shaping our understanding of cultural phenomena.

### #1 — Inaugural Seminar: 20 November 2024, Lab42, L3.33, 15:30-17:00

***Speaker 1: Dr Abdallah El Ali (CWI, UU)***

Abstract: As AI-generated information proliferates online and becomes increasingly indistinguishable from human-sourced information, it becomes critical to understand how we trust and label such content, especially should such information be inaccurate. For example, misleading labels or unclear sourcing can result in misinformation and poor health decisions, even if (honest) AI system disclosures are increasingly mandated by regulations (e.g., European AI Act). In this talk, I will highlight the importance of considering ‘what’, ‘how’, and ‘when’ AI disclosures are given within two domains, news media content and personal health information. I will show early results on how AI transparency disclosures can impact people’s perceived trust, behavior, and physiological indicators. I will conclude by highlighting our research efforts for creating *responsible* human-AI interactions at the user interface level, specifically the potential for developing intelligent user interfaces that can infer if and when to apply AI disclosures using sensed behavioral and physiological data.

About the Speaker: Abdallah “Abdo” El Ali is a research scientist at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, and part-time Assistant Professor at Utrecht University. He leads the research areas on Affective Interactive Systems and Trustworthy Human-AI Interaction, where he combines advances in sensing and actuation, eXtended Reality, and Artificial Intelligence to augment human cognitive, affective, and social interactions. He is also affiliated with the AI, Media, and Democracy Lab, where he leads Human-AI Interaction research focusing on AI transparency in media.
